Following up the previously upvoted answer, tried to intentionally break the device driver from working normally.

SUCCESSFULL!!

1) Device manager > Mice and Pointing devices > PS/2 Compatible Mouse > Right Click and Select "Update Driver Software" > Browse My Computer for driver software > 'Let Me pick from a list of device drivers......."

2) Untick "Show Compatible hardware"

3) Select a driver other than "MICROSOFT : PS/2 Compatible Mouse"

4) Restart and DONE!!!!!

to revert back select the driver as "MICROSOFT : PS/2 Compatible Mouse" and restart :)
